Ok so after a whole weekend of playing Risk we came out with the need for making big battles much faster, I'm talking about those times when an army of 15+ troops attacks a territory with an army of 15+ troops, therefore I decided to build a function that would roll the dices as many times as needed to perform a battle for a territory without having to touch the dices.

Note: It may take some joy out of dueling to death dice by dice.
